# ðŸŽ²Command-Line Sodoku + SolverðŸŽ²
This project implements a Sodoku Game that can be played exclusively on the Command-Line. The user can decide to play the game as they wish, or they can see the solution (which is implemented in the SodokuGame Class using a backtracking algorithm (time complexity of O(n^2)). In addition, when the user selects to see the solved puzzle, the number of steps (or iterations) to complete the puzzle is printed along with the solution.
